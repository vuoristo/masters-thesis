Dynamic workload conditions are emulated by repeating the measurements with different factors. To keep the measurement setup simple the video streams are not dynamically switched at runtime. The measurement parameters are presented in the following listing.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Video Frame Size} - The workloads are differentiated by changing the frame sizes of the video streams.
    \item \textbf{OpenEM Core Masks} - The OpenEM application is measured with different core masks of the Execution Objects.
    \item \textbf{Number of Frames Processed Simultaneously} - The OpenEM application processes variable number of frames simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

The different video frame sizes used are presented in table \ref{tab:cif_frames}. The frame sizes used are selected from among the Common Intermediate Format frame sizes. YUV video format is used in the applications, but only the Y channel is processed by the applications. The Y channel in the YUV frame contains $R_{x} * R_{y}$ bytes where $R$ is the resolution. In the YUV format used the U and V channels have reduced bitrates of $\frac{1}{4} * R_{x} * R_{y}$ per frame.

The OpenEM application circulates the events created initially throughout its lifetime. The number of initial events determines the maximum number of frames that can be processed simultaneously. The effect of the number of the simultaneously processed frames to the latency and throughput of the application is examined in the experiments.

OpenEM core masks are used to limit the number of cores available to the filter application. The behavior of OpenEM is examined under limited resources. With the use of core masks the performance improvement through increased parallelism is investigated.
