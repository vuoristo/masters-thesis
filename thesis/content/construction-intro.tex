This chapter describes the implementation of the applications studied in the experiments. The workload application was inspired by Canny filter. Two versions of the workload are implemented and both are instrumented for measurement. Three experiments were designed for comparison of the applications.

To begin this chapter the general idea of the workload application is introduced in~\ref{sec:filterapp}. Then the PREESM implementation of the application is described in~\ref{sec:preesmapp}. Next the OpenEM implementation is explained in~\ref{sec:oemapp}. After the applications have been described, the instrumentation explained in~\ref{sec:instrumentation}. Finally the experiments introduced in~\ref{sec:experiment-description}.
