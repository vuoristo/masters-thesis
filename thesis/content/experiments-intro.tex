The objective of this thesis is to understand the performance of the Texas Instruments implementation of Open Event Machine in stream processing. The objective is achieved by implementing a video stream processing application using OpenEM, measuring its performance and comparing that to a comparable, statically scheduled application. The comparable application is implemented using the PREESM framework. Both of the applications are instrumented in similar manner.

In this chapter the material and methods used in the experiment are introduced. The performance and behavior of OpenEM is evaluated using quantitative analysis. The analysis methods are explained in section \ref{sec:performance-analysis}. The hardware platform used in the experiments is the Texas Instruments TMS320C6678, which is described in \ref{sec:c6678}. PREESM provides the framework for implementing the comparable workload. PREESM is introduced in section \ref{sec:preesm}. The workload application processes video streams. An overview to video streams is provided in section \ref{sec:video-streams}. The algorithms computed in the stream processing application are part of the Canny edge detection algorithm introduced in \ref{sec:canny}. Finally, the structure of the workload application is described in the section \ref{sec:filterapp}.
