The objective of these experiments is to understand the behavior and performance of the Texas Instruments implementation of Open Event Machine in realtime stream processing. The objective is achieved by comparing the behavior of an application implemented using OpenEM to the behavior of a similar application implemented using a simpler multicore runtime system (PREESM) in the first part of the experiment.

Both of the experiments are described in a similar manner. First the parameters and factors of the experiments are explained, second the different measurement setups are introduced and third the results of the measurements are presented. The comparison of the PREESM and OpenEM applications is described in the section \ref{sec:firstexperiment}.

\fixme{as there are many different experiments discussed here, there should be a summarizing list in the beginning to help the reader grasp what's going on}
