\fixme{explain why video streams}
The objective of this thesis is to understand the behavior and performance of the Texas Instruments implementation of Open Event Machine in realtime stream processing. The objective is achieved by implementing a video stream processing application using OpenEM and measuring its performance. A comparable video stream processing application is implemented using the PREESM framework. Both of the applications are instrumented in similar manner, and their performance is compared.

In this chapter the material and methods used in the experiment are introduced. The performance and behavior of OpenEM is evaluated using quantitative analysis. The analysis methods are explained in section \ref{sec:performance-analysis}. The hardware platform used in the experiments is the Texas Instruments TMS320C6678, which is described in \ref{sec:c6678}. PREESM provides the framework for implementing the comparable workload. PREESM is introduced in section \ref{sec:preesm}. The workload application processes video streams. An overview to video streams is provided in section \ref{sec:video-streams}. The algorithms computed in the stream processing application are part of the Canny edge detection algorithm introduced in \ref{sec:canny}. Finally, the structure of the workload application is described in the section \ref{sec:filterapp}.
