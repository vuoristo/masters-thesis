Three experiments were conducted to understand the performance of OpenEM in stream processing. Stream processing application was implemented with OpenEM and a comparable application was implemented using PREESM. The performance of the application as a part of a stream processing system was not studied. Therefore IO was omitted from the stream processing task that both of the applications implemented.  The experiments focused on understanding the performance of the OpenEM scheduler in handling stream processing tasks.

In this section the results of the three conducted experiments are discussed. First the discoveries made from the experiments are described in \ref{subsec:discoveries}. Second the possible directions of future work are discussed in \ref{subsec:future-work}. Finally the challenges faced conducting the experiments are explained in \ref{subsec:challenges}
