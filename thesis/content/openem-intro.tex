This thesis investigates the suitability of Open Event Machine (OpenEM) for real-time stream processing. OpenEM is a programming framework for event-driven multicore applications. \fixme{more context: by whom? for which platform? which active versions? etc. what's the purpose of this intro vs. the one in the Framework section?}

At the time of writing there are no public documentation resources for the Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) implementation of OpenEM other than the documentation included in the OpenEM source files available at \cite{openempage} and the introductory slides at \cite{openemintro}. Hardware vendor implementations of OpenEM exist and may have more complete documentation available as is the case for the Texas Instruments OpenEM implementation introduced in section \ref{sec:tiopenem}.

\fixme{the framework introduction covers the topic and structure pretty well.  the division should be clearer.}
