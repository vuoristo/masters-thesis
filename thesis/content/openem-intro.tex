This thesis investigates the performance of Open Event Machine (OpenEM) for stream processing. OpenEM is a programming framework for creating multicore applications. It was originally developed by Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) for the networking dataplane~\cite{openemintro}. 

In this chapter the OpenEM framework is introduced. To get a good view of the framework, parallel computing is discussed in~\ref{sec:parallel-computing}. The section about parallel computing contains descriptions of task parallelism, which is the form of parallelism implemented by OpenEM and event-driven programming, which is the model of concurrency used in OpenEM. After the context has been introduced two views to the OpenEM framework are provided. First, the OpenEM framework as specified by Nokia is described in \ref{sec:emframework}. Second, the Texas Instruments implementation of the OpenEM framework for TMS320C6678 is explained in~\ref{sec:tiopenem}.
