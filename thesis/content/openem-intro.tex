This thesis investigates the suitability of Open Event Machine (OpenEM) for real-time stream processing. OpenEM is a programming framework for event-driven multicore applications originally developed by Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) for the networking dataplane \cite{openemintro}. 

In this chapter two views to the OpenEM framework are provided. First, the OpenEM framework as introduced by NSN, is described in \ref{sec:emframework}. Second, the Texas Instruments implementation of the OpenEM framework for TMS320C6678 is explained in~\ref{sec:tiopenem}.
