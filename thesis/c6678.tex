\label{chapter:c6678}
This chapter describes the Texas Instruments TMS320C6678 multicore DSP. First
the selection of the TMS320C6678 as the hardware platform for the experiments
is explained. Second the key hardware features of the platform and
the related development tools are examined.

\section{Selection of the Hardware Platform}
The hardware platform used in the experiments in this thesis is the  
Advantech TMDSEVM6678L TMS320C6678 Evaluation Module. The processor in the
evaluation module is the Texas Instruments TMS320C6678. The TMS320C6678
is a fixed and floating point digital signal processor based on the
Texas Instruments Keystone I architecture. The processor has eight
C66x DSP cores at 1.0 GHz clock frequency \cite{tmsdatasheet}.

The TMS320C6678 was chosen as the hardware platform for the experiments
for two main reasons. First the Keystone I architecture is designed with
stream processing applications in mind \cite{multicorevideo}. Second the
objective of this thesis is to understand hardware and software features
supported by the TMS320C6678.

The specific features in the TMS320C6678 we are interested in are the
support for OpenEM included in the MCSDK for Keystone I devices
\cite{MCSDKbrochure} and the hardware accelerated scheduling and
communication utilized by the OpenEM runtime. 

An additional benefit of choosing TMS320C6678 as the hardware platform for
the experiments is the support for the platform in PREESM
\cite{pelcat2014preesm}.

The Keystone I architecture the TMS320C6678 is based on specifies a set of
hardware elements which enable integration of DSP cores, application specific
co-processors and IO \cite{tmsdatasheet}. In the Keystone I architecture there
are multiple ways for the C66x cores to communicate with each other, the memory
and the peripherals. The methods of communication of specific interest for the
experiments in this thesis are communication through shared memory discussed in
\ref{subsec:c66memory} and communication through packet based communication
manager Multicore Navigator introduced in \ref{subsec:multicorenav}.

The development board used for development of the experiment applications and 
measurements was an Advantech TMDXEVM6678L. TMDXEVM6678L is an evaluation module
and hardware reference design platform for the TMS320C6678 multicore DSP. The
evaluation module provides 512 megabytes of DDR3 memory and an onboard XDS100
emulator with USB connectivity along with other features. \cite{evmref} The 
connectivity provided by the onboard emulator simplified developing and
debugging for the platform. The memory on the evaluation module helped us omit
the IO from the application design.

The IDE used for development of the experiment applications is called Code
Composer Studio. CCS version 5.2. is distributed with the evaluation module.
CCS is discussed in detail in \ref{subsec:devtools}.
