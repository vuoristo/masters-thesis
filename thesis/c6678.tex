\label{chapter:c6678}
Briefly what is TMS320C6678
Structure of the chapter
\section{Motivation}
Why did we choose TMS over other candidates
    We are interested in OpenEM
        There exists a Keyston I implementation of OpenEM
    We are interested in Hardware Accelerated Scheduling and Communication
        TMS utilizes PDSP cores for scheduling
        TMS utilizes QMSS for inter core communication
    PREESM supports TMS320C6678
        Preesm is a quick and dirty prototyping tool for multicore programs
