Actor Model is selected as the top-level programming model for the workload application. Actor Models are specifically designed for parallel programming and fit the OpenEM defined application layout well. Prototyping Actor Model programs is straightforward due to available graphical tools. Actor Model rapid prototyping tool PREESM will be utilized in the experiment to build a simple version of the workload. PREESM was selected over comparable tools for the following reasons: 1. PREESM supports TMS320C6678 as a compilation target. 2. PREESM is under active development.

PREESM version 2.1.3 and Eclipse Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2) will be used in the experiment.
