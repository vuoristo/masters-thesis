Two applications and a simulation model are implemented for the experiment. The simulation model is potentially interesting for future research on the subject. Representing the simulation model can be compactly done by providing the reader with pictures of the resource network accompanied with description of the model. A simplified representation of the PREESM actor model could be also included.

As there are many measurement setups generating a lot of data, the representation of the measurements needs to be carefully designed. The initial idea is to use tables listing the different application setups on one axis and the stream setups on the other axis to present data from a single measurement. Key measurements will be visualized using suitable graphs.
