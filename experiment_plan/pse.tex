\subsection{Performance Simulation Environment}
Performance Simulation Environment (PSE) is a resource network based simulation environment that can be used to construct models of applications at different levels of abstraction. If a low abstraction level simulation model is desired, specific measurements of the runtime are needed. The measurements conducted on the second iteration will depend on the needs of the simulation model.
\subsection{Modeling the workload using PSE}
PSE will be used to construct a resource network model of the OpenEM based workload application. Building a resource network model will help us generalize the findings from the experiment.
