\subsection{Performance Simulation Environment}
Performance Simulation Environment (PSE) is a resource network based simulation environment that can be used to construct models of applications at different levels of abstraction. If a low abstraction level simulation model is desired, specific measurements of the runtime are needed. The measurements conducted on the second iteration will depend on the needs of the simulation model.
\subsection{Modeling the workload using PSE}
The main objective of this experiment is to understand OpenEM as a computation platform for stream computation. Analysis of stream computation is complicated especially on load balanced platforms such as TI implementation of OpenEM. One method of analysis is modeling and simulation of the application. A simulation model of the OpenEM application is constructed firstly to improve understanding of the OpenEM runtime system and secondly to evaluate modeling and simulation as a method of understanding stream computation.
