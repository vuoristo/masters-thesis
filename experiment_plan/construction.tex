\subsection{Video Filter Application Using PREESM}
An actor network is constructed in PREESM that represents the video filter application. A network sketch is presented in Figure~\ref{sketch}.

To keep the model simple and the program well analyzable all of the processing paths in the network are independent. The shared dependencies in the sketch (marked with dashed lines) are constants related to the video stream and will change in the actual application.

The first actor on each of the processing paths loads the video frames from memory and passes them to splitting actors. The splitting actor splits the frames to a suitable number of splices to enable processing of the same video stream on multiple cores. The filter actor follows the splitting actor. Partial frames filtered in the filter actor are merged back to whole frames in the merge actors. The last actors on each processing path are sink actors that collect data from the execution and frees resources.

The filter actors are run on all cores following a manually created schedule. The manual schedule determines the execution in the simpler runtime system and is thus very important for the experiment results. The details of the schedule are determined according to the workload cases generated.
\subsection{Video Filter Application Using OpenEM}
The video filter application first constructed as a PREESM actor model, will be implemented using OpenEM. The mapping from the actors in the actor model to the execution objects in OpenEM is expected to be one-to-one. An execution object is allocated for each actor in the actor model. The events passed between the actors encapsulate the data in the video streams.

In contrast to the PREESM application where the schedule has to be changed for each streaming case, the OpenEM implementation will not be changed for the different workloads.

The specifics of setting up the execution objects, number of queues attached to them, the priority of the queues and other specifics depend heavily on the final workload application and thus are not further explained here. The details are also subject to change based on the initial measurements to make the workload better reflect a realistic application.
\subsection{Workload}
The workload application needs to be kept simple to keep it analyzable. Complex parts of real applications unrelated to the parallel execution such as I/O are omitted from the workload implementation. Without I/O available the video streams need to be preloaded to the memory. CCS provides tools for preloading.

The purpose of the experiment is to understand the OpenEM behavior under dynamic load. Organizing the workload so that the number of streams could actually be dynamically changed at runtime will not be necessary if the cost of switching between streams can be estimated. A number of static loads will be constructed and measured on both of the applications.
