This thesis investigates stream processing on a multicore DSP featuring hardware accelerated scheduling. The research platform is the Texas Instruments implementation of Open Event Machine which utilizes hardware accelerated scheduling through Multicore Navigator.

In this thesis: 1. Two versions of a realistic stream processing application are implemented using PREESM and OpenEM. 2. The performance of the applications is measured under dynamic load. 3. A resource network simulation model of the OpenEM application is constructed.
