This thesis investigates stream processing on a multicore DSP featuring hardware accelerated scheduling. The research platform is the Texas Instruments implementation of Open Event Machine which utilizes hardware accelerated scheduling through Multicore Navigator.

In this thesis: 1. A realistic application implementing stream processing is created using OpenEM on a Texas Instruments multicore DSP. 2. The application is tested on a instrumented platform to get real world measurements of the execution. 3. Static analysis is used to estimate the execution. 4. Dynamic analysis is conducted on the application to further understand the performance and study the analysability of such applications.
