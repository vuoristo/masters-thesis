Risto is currently an IEM (TuTa) student. In a discussion with Kivi-Koskinen Elsa who handles master's program studies at CSE I was assured that getting a supervisor will not be a problem before I'm officially CSE student. The thesis topic can be officially approved only after I've started at CSE which will mean the beginning of September.

It is currently unknown how difficult it will be to implement and analyze a suitable workload with the TI implementation of OpenEM. How well do OpenEM queues, multicore navigator and dynamic workloads play together? The number of events to be queued is unknown at compile time.
