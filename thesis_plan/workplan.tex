\subsection{First iteration}
set-up -> construct -> analyze -> repeat

Setting up the platform has already started. Compilation, execution and limited analysis possible on the TMS320C6678. Setting up will continue with getting more familiar with OpenEM, building and executing some OpenEM applications on the device.

More efforts on the analysis tools are needed but since the platform provides wide analysis support, more information about the specific needs is necessary before exploring analysis further.

\subsection{More iterations}
Depending on the findings from the first iteration further iterations may be needed.
