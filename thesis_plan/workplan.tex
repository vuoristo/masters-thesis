\subsection{First iteration}
set-up -> construct -> analyze -> repeat

The experiment has been planned in detail. The tools have been installed and example applications compiled and run. Next step is to actually implement the workload.

Analysis phase of the experiment has been planned in less detail due to uncertainty about the challenges in workload implementation and the analysis tools. On a high level, TI provides libraries and other tools to access performance counters and trace from the device. PSE will be used to construct a resource network simulation model of the workload.

\subsection{More iterations}
Depending on the findings from the first iteration further iterations may be needed.
