The objective of this thesis is to understand the Open Event Machine programming model and the OpenEM runtime system in the context of stream processing. A stream processing application is implemented using OpenEM to understand the dynamic scheduling. A resource network simulation model of the OpenEM application is constructed to further understand the OpenEM runtime system and to evaluate modeling and simulation as analysis method for stream processing on load balanced platforms. 

For example a DSP faces a situation where it is processing N video streams at time A. At time B there are M video streams. The problem this thesis solves is how to allocate the computation resources on the DSP dynamically so that the variable amount of streams can be processed efficiently.
