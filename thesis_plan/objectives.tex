The objective of this thesis is to study the utilization of hardware accelerated scheduling on a multicore DSP in handling dynamically changing workloads. An application is implemented which demonstrates efficient dynamic scheduling for stream processing. The application needs to resemble real world applications run on similar devices to ensure the applicability of the results.

For example a DSP faces a situation where it is processing N video streams at time A. At time B there are M video streams. The problem this thesis solves is how to reallocate the computation resources on the DSP dynamically so that the variable amount of streams can be processed efficiently.
