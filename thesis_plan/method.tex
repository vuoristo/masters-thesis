Workload construction, measurements and modeling are discussed in detail in the experiment plan.

The OpenEM programming model and runtime system are studied using \textbf{comparison} and \textbf{modeling} as the methods. A workload application is constructed with a simple runtime system (PREESM) and then converted to OpenEM runtime. The two applications are compared under different load conditions.

The OpenEM application is modeled for resource network simulation. The construction of simulation model needs detailed information about the OpenEM runtime system and the workload application. The data from the measurements is used for the timings needed in the simulation model.

To keep the implementation simple all I/O is omitted from the experiment. The omission of I/O is justified by keeping the experiment strictly focused on the computation in stream processing. The effects of an I/O layer to the studied workload are investigated through literature.
